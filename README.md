# College Event Website
The goal of this project is to create a website that allows students from different universities to create and host events for their communities. These events can be private, public, or specific to specific RSOs that are created through the application. There are three tiers of users on the website: normal users, who can join/create rsos and join events available to them; admins, who can create events for RSOs that they are the admin of; and super-admins, who control the university.
Users are also able to comment on events that they are part of, and features default PHP password encryption.

## Technical Specifications
The web-based application was created using a MySQLi backend with InnoDB to support functional dependencies. PHP is used for server-user connections, and the front-end was created using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JS.

The project was created and tested locally using WAMP, which is a Windows based application that automatically integrates Apache, MySQLi, and PHP for easy and quick development. Firefox and Microsoft Edge were both used to validate front-end visuals.
